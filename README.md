# ResidualLightGCN

This repository contains the code for implementing ResidualLightGCN and generate performance metrics on the MovieLens 100k dataset for Collaborative Filtering methods, namely SVD, LightGCN and ResidualLightGCN.

'SVD.ipynb' contains the code for SVD collaborative filtering and 'ResidualLightGCN.ipynb' has the code for the GNN methods. These files are meant to be run in Google Colab, which already have some of the necessary dependencies.
